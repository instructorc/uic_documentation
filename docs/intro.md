## Course Description

Web applications integrate concepts from software engineering, systems programming, and computer security. Teaches security through web development, enabling students to design, deploy, scale, attack, and defend modern web applications. 

## Course Overview

Web applications are simultaneously one of the most widely used and widely attacked forms of deployed code. At the same time, the concepts of computer security are best taught within a relatable context so that students can immediately apply their knowledge to relevant situations. The unique challenges inherent in building secure web applications made available to billions of potential users and attackers requires understanding how to use and integrate concepts from software engineering, systems programming, and computer security. This course integrates the concepts that underlie designing, deploying, attacking, and defending web applications to provide students with a foundational understanding of how to design and deploy scalable and secure web applications.

This class will teach students the concepts and techniques that enable web applications to maintain high performance in the face of numerous users and attackers. Students will learn and be able to apply software engineering concepts to manage the complexity of client‐side and server‐side software. Students will learn and be able to apply computer systems concepts to manage the scalability of the web application, and provide performant service to large numbers of simultaneous users. Students will learn and be able to apply computer security concepts to designing a web application which is robust to known and unknown attacks. Students will gain familiarity and facility with modern tools which enable creating applications that apply the aforementioned design, performance, and security concepts. Students will learn and be able to apply fundamental security concepts so that they can evaluate the security of future application designs in the face of potential future attacks.
