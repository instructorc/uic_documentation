## Course Description

Web applications integrate concepts from software engineering, systems programming, and computer security. Teaches security through web development, enabling students to design, deploy, scale, attack, and defend modern web applications. 

## Course Overview

This course integrates the concepts that underlie designing, deploying, attacking, and defending web applications to provide students with a foundational understanding of how to design and deploy scalable and secure web applications.

This class will teach students the concepts and techniques that enable web applications to maintain high performance in the face of numerous users and attackers. Students will learn and be able to apply software engineering concepts to manage the complexity of client‐side and server‐side software. Students will learn and be able to apply computer systems concepts to manage the scalability of the web application, and provide performant service to large numbers of simultaneous users. Students will learn and be able to apply computer security concepts to designing a web application which is robust to known and unknown attacks. Students will gain familiarity and facility with modern tools which enable creating applications that apply the aforementioned design, performance, and security concepts. Students will learn and be able to apply fundamental security concepts so that they can evaluate the security of future application designs in the face of potential future attacks.

## Late Work Policy

All assignments must be submitted by the due date and time listed on the assignment. If assignment is not turned in by the due date and time listed, the assignment will not receive points and will be assessed a zero for the assignment.

Students are permitted to continue work on assignments beyond the due date if a grade has not posted. Once a grade post for the assignment, no further progress on the assignment can be made.

## Academic Honesty

Cheating, plagiarism, and any other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated

## COVID-19 Mask Mandate

Face Masks: Masks covering both the mouth and nose must be worn at all times by all students, faculty, and staff while on campus and inside any building regardless of vaccination status.  If you do not wear a mask, you will be asked to leave the classroom and will not be allowed back in class unless or until you wear a mask. If you have forgotten your mask, you may pick one up from one of the student information desks on campus during the first two weeks of campus. Students who do not comply with the mask-wearing policy will be reported to the Dean of Students. Eating and drinking are not allowed in classrooms.
